rxjs: The takeUntil operator gives us a way to cancel a subscription to an observable. We add the operator to our observable pipeline and provide it with a subject. Whenever that subject emits a value the subscription will be cancelled. 
Without using this we would need to track all the subscriptions individually.

private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();
takeUntil(this.destroy$)
